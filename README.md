# Subject-information-web-app
we create a web application that provides subject information to a student. Upon 
running the application, the following information will be displayed about INT316D: 
• Name and email address of the Subject Head; 
• Name and code of the subject; 
• Name and email address of the eMalahleni lecturer; 
• Name and email address of the Polokwane lecturer; and 
• Name and email address of the Soshanguve lecturer. 
To demonstrate the difference between ServletConfig (local variables) and 
ServletContext (global variables), the details of the subject and that of the 
Subject Head will be accessed via the ServletContext, and the rest through the 
ServletConfig.
